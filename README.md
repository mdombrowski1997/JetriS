This is a simple implementation of a tetromino game.

The primary goal of this application is to be droppable into any 
pre-existing environment and run predictably from a browser with 
dependencies of just Bootstrap and jQuery.

Also, this is necessary because there are add-on tetromino JS programs 
like this out there, but they are unplayable, and I guess they exist 
more as a proof of concept than an enjoyable site add-on.
